  **Customer Churn Prediction & Retention**:

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, indicating the rate at which customers stop using a service or product. Predicting churn allows companies to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, optimize marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project focuses on customer churn prediction and retention analysis using Python and machine learning, leveraging advanced data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights and develop effective retention strategies. By analyzing historical customer behavior, identifying key churn indicators, and implementing predictive models, businesses can reduce churn rates and enhance long-term customer engagement.
